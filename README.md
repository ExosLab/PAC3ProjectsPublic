Public Release of PAC3s

**DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I AM DOING** -

I was unsure of where to reach out to the wider PAC3 community, and regardless for personal reasons decided not to. 
As far as I can tell, sharing a PAC3 outfit is as simple as handing off the .txt files to other users.
I will note that after uninstalling and reinstalling Garry's Mod, *v2_fightingmachine.txt* and *v2_sprinter.txt* were misbehaving, in the latter case becoming completely nonfunctional (on my machine, no one else has tried it). I imagine the files may have become somewhat corrupted, though the former remains usable beyond a few animation issues.
I do not know how PAC3 outfits might affect each other, I don't think they do, I have no reason to believe they do, and other outfits I have on hand still seem to behave. If you know better than me, please notify me and I will remove the offending outfits.

For all I know this is only an issue on my own machine, and they'll work perfectly on other machines. I just wanted to give a heads up.

**These are the PAC3 outfits I showed off on YouTube**, plus two bonuses. I will quickly explain which is which:

- practicetripod.txt -

*This is the tripod featured in the videos "PAC3 Tripod WIP," "PAC3 Tripod Feature Reel," and "Unedited Fighting Machine Combat Trial." It is the more basic of the two tripods, having very stiff animations, but it would provide a better reference point for people learning how to do this.*

- v2_fightingmachine.txt - 

*This is the tripod featured in the videos "PAC3 Tripod V2 WIP," "Yep, Still Working On It (Tripod V2)," and an as of now unreleased demo real. This is the more complex tripod featuring (what I would consider) a pretty neat amount of animation, several additional features that the original did not have (such as a probe), and overall is far more original. There is a tradeoff, at some point the file seems to have been slightly corrupted, it still works but the animation timings are slightly off and I cannot fix them. It's frustrating but it's not a huge deal.*

-  tripodmovementanimationbase.txt -

*This is the Tripod V2 but striped down to its basic rigging. Feel free to build your own designs based on this, though you'll have to do the heavy lifting in terms of adding in features.*

- v2_sprinter.txt -

*This outfit is, as far as I can tell, completely nonfunctional. I am uploading it here for preservation's sake. This outfit was to be debuted alongside Tripod V2's demo reel however became completely unusable after some time away from Garry's Mod. This is a small tripod built off antlions that I was going to use in-place of a probe on V2 if I couldn't figure out how to do it.*

Special thanks to Starry for their amazing tutorials on the subject matter, and FirePenguin99 for their tutorials on PAC3 Projectiles.
Also a big thanks to the creator of the outfit *"tutorial tripod base.txt"*, which I downloaded from a YouTube Community post. I would never have figured out how to do probes without that tutorial, though I am now unable to find the post from which I downloaded it. If you know the creator/are the creator, please notify me so I can credit you properly.
